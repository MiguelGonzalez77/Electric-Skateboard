# Electric-Skateboard


This is a program to create your very own electric skateboard. What it does is basically what an electric skateboard does, which will have a seperate remote that 
controls the LEDs on the electric skateboard and control the speed of the electric skateboard. However, this doesn't program an existing electric skateboard, although 
you could implement it, but they could have different drivers, so it is up to you. The parts utilized for the skateboard is listed in the txt file, of course you can 
implement different hardware devices that could allocate much more power or better components to fit your desires. This code is all in C.
